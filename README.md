# Hello Demo


## Description

_Hello Demo_ is a proof-of-concept to build an asynchronous API call using the [Archive.org Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade) game collection.

Once the FETCH call is complete, an embed container is created and delivered to the DOM.

## Installation

This project can be cloned and initiated using a local web server (e.g. [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code).

## Usage

The project can be accessed via GitHub Pages at [https://jon-xo.github.io/hello-demo/](https://jon-xo.github.io/hello-demo/). When the Hello Demo page is reloaded, it will cycle through a random game via strings stored in the `findGame` array located in `main.js`.
